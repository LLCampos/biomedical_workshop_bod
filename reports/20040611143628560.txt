Discussion Retinoblastoma is the most common primary intraocular tumor of childhood , and should be a primary consideration in the differential diagnosis of leukocoria .
Intraocular calcifications in a child are indicative of retinoblastoma until proven otherwise , and the other causes of leukocoria ( i . e .
PHPV , Coat ' s dz , Toxocara , ROP ) are rarely if ever calcified .
The tumors are thought to arise from primitive photoreceptor cells , and 25 % are bilateral or multifocal .
Invasion of the optic nerve portends a poor prognosis .
10 % are hereditary , associated with a deletion on chromosome 13q .
These patients are at risk for developing pineal tumors , extracranial sarcomas , and melanoma .
When a patient with retinoblastoma develops a pineal tumor , the term trilateral retinoblastoma is used .

Children ' s Memorial Hospital Abstract 3 . 5 yo female with bowlegs Keywords Blount Disease Publication Date : 2004 - 06 - 16 History 3 . 5 yo female with bowlegs Findings Beaking and irregularity of the medial proximal tibial metaphysis , tibia vara Diagnosis Blount Disease Differential D - resistant ( familial hypophosphatemic ) rickets , developmental / physiologic bowing Discussion The young child with bowlegs walks with his hips abducted and externally rotated and his knees flexed on tibias that have increased internal tibial torsion .
A significant association with obesity has been noted .
Two forms of Blount disease have been identified : infantile tibia vara , which is usually bilateral and affects children under 10 yo , with onset most commonly between 1 - 3 yo ; and adolescent tibia vara , which is usually unilateral and occurs in children between the ages of 8 - 5 yo .
The course of the adolsecent form of the disease is less severe and its incidence less frequent than in the infantile form .
Based on the progession of radiographic changes in Blount disease , congenital tibia vara is divided into 6 stages as a guideline for prognosis and treatment .
A metaphyseal - diaphyseal angle ( a line drawn across the tibial metaphysis compared with one perpendicular to the tibial axis ) of more than 11 degrees may predict the deveopment of tibia vara before typical radiologic findings occur .

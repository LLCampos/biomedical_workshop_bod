Diagnosis Ollier ' s Disease Discussion The syndrome of multiple enchondromas or enchondromatosis is known as Ollier disease .
If the enchondromatosis is associated with soft tissue hemangiomas , the disorder is called Maffucci syndrome .
Enchondromatosis is a rare , nonheriditary disorder .
Enchondromas are usually solitary , located in the metaphyseal region of tubular bones , and the favored sites are the short tubular bones of the hands and feet .
Chondromas are thought to develop from rests of growth plate cartilage that subsequently proliferate and slowly enlarge .
Based on this theory , it is not surprising that these tumors arise mainly in bones that develop from enchondral ossification .
